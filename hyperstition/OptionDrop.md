# Option Drop
Instead of airdrops, where people get tokens for free, we offer option drops. These are similar to airdrops, but instead of receiving tokens immediately, users receive options to purchase tokens at a discounted price. This incentivizes early adoption and helps to build a community around the project.

Airdrops have fallen out of favor recently, due to high sell pressure in recent airdrops. Option Drops accomplish many of the same goals as airdrop (targeting initial community, incentivizing contributors, rewarding beneficial behavior), but still require the user to pay something for the project token.

Importantly, option drops also allow for incentivizing activity and targeting specific users. The more criteria you meet, and the more you contribute, the more your discount.

Some option drop mechanics might include:
- Option Drops to twitter accounts, Discord servers, open source contributors on GitHub, and other platforms with users worth targeting
- Higher discount for being part of key communities (i.e. GitCoin donors, cryptopunk owners, etc.)
- Higher discount for participation in key online or IRL events
- Higher discount for being an early user of apps on testnet

Option Drops should be vested to prevent sell pressure.

- Contribution caps
- Strike price?

- Maybe model it as poistion to buy on a price curve? Maybe price curves are stupid.
- Step pricing


## Questions

How long should people be able to claim / excercise their option drop?
- 1 year

How should option drops vest?
- 1 year? Maybe it's dynamic based on the amount of the discount.
- Unlocks linearly based on amount vested? Alternatively could unlock based on project performance?

What qualifies?
- Everyone who plays Aminals gets a discount on their option drop.
- Juno Network stakers
- Bad Kids holders
- GitCoin contributors
- Cryptopunk owners
- Open Source Contributors
- Groups that support privacy and sovereign technologies
- NFT holders
- A bunch of others
- People that try apps on testnet
