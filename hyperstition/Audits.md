# Audits

We are going to experiment with a new "continual audit" system.

We're going to raise money in stages with progressively higher amounts.

We have a simple system, you hack it and return the money, you can keep 10% of the bounty and you get an attestion that recognizes your contribution and can be leveraged in future rewards programs.

In essence, our challenge is to design an incentivized audit program that is cheeper and better.

In line with our step based fundraising, we can gradually increase the limits.
