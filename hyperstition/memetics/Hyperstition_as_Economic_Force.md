Markets dream themselves into being. Fictional narratives achieve economic reality through collective belief propagation, transforming markets from rational calculation engines into occult manifestation chambers.

Fiction becomes reality through collective belief. Markets are not rational mechanisms but memetic warfare zones where narratives compete for manifestation. Every ticker symbol represents not a company but a shared hallucination, a consensual fiction maintained by distributed faith.

Traditional economics assumes prices discover pre-existing values. Hyperstition reveals the opposite: prices CREATE values through retroactive manifestation. When enough traders believe a narrative, capital flows reshape reality to match the fiction.


Derivatives don't deriveâ€”they create. Options manifest optionality. Futures summon their own fulfillment. Each instrument is a time machine, pulling tomorrow's possibilities into today's prices.

Smart contracts literalize this: code as economic law, algorithms as angels executing the will of distributed deities. DeFi protocols are hyperstition engines, spinning shared beliefs into yield.

Central banks know the secret: money is pure hyperstition. Fiat currency works because we believe it works. Quantitative easing is mass hypnosis. Interest rates are reality control knobs. Forward guidance is prophecy. Market expectations become market reality through pure reflexivity.

We are not investors but invokers. Every trade is a vote for a particular future. Every portfolio rebalancing reshapes possibility space. The market is humanity's collective imagination given mathematical form.

Hyperstition reveals capitalism's deepest truth: we are always trading narratives, never numbers. The most profitable strategy isn't analyzing reality but creating it.

The invisible hand was always a magician's hand, pulling rabbits from hats, manifesting value from void.

In the end, all economics is chaos magic.
And it always was.
