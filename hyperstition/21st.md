# Things to potentially launch / do on September 21st, 2025
- Open Source WAVS
- Hyperstition markets
- Vouching system
- Vercel for AVS (pay to run components)
- "Bridge" progress
- FSV DAICO

### Bridge Progress Ideas (moving towards EN0 Protocol)
- Support cross-chain standards
- Support vaults (ERC-4626)
- Support "commitments" (i.e. I want to use my balance in the vault to gamble on a WAVS application, if I lose it gets redistributed)
