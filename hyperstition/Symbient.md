People can attest to:
- How they feel.
- How they think we should run things.
- Stories
- Beliefs
- etc.

These attestations feed the knowledge graph of a symbient.

The symbient can also attest.

You can think of its "mind" as weighted set of attestations. These attestations are the building blocks of the symbient's knowledge graph.

Some attestations are so important they go directly into the symbient's LLM context, others are available via a RAG.
