## Locking

Locking is a core mechanism for EN0VA. Locking tokens gives you voting power (which in turn determines, resource allocation).

The longer you lock your tokens, the more voting power you gain. This incentivizes long-term participation and helps to ensure the stability and sustainability of the project.

Sometimes this is called a "Vote Escrow" contract.
