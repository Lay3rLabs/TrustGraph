# Launchpad

The "Launchpad" initially has to serve just us. WE ARE BUILDING IT FOR OURSELVES AND OUR COMMUNITY.

Of course, we hope to leverage some cool new WAVS-enabled mechanisms to make it awesome. If we successful launch our own project, then we can start using it for others.

Our launchpad is an *ecosystem incubator* designed to bootstrap novel verifiable applications that create real value.

Aspirational feature list (to be prioritized):
- Launch DAICOs
- Enhanced Investor Protections
- Multichain enabled (users can participate from anywhere)
- Futarchy: Prediction / Decision Markets
- Metric based vesting
- Performance based incentives
- Option drops
