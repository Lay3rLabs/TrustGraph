# Vesting

We want to leverage vesting in a few ways:
- For our investors
- For the core team
- For the community that earns enough points to get an airdrop
- Potentially for the option drop

The [MetaLex vesting contracts](https://github.com/MetaLex-Tech/MetaVesT) are a solid foundation to build on as they support a large number of features including milestones and option purchases.

#### Notes / Ideas
A portion of team tokens unlock via milestones (hitting certain project goals).

When we hit certain milestones we unlock funds faster on early investors

If the project is succeeding they unlock faster, but otherwise vest on a time basis.
