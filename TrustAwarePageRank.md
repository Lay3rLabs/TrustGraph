# TrustAwarePageRank: Spam-Resistant Reputation Systems

## Abstract

TrustAwarePageRank is an extension of the traditional PageRank algorithm designed to create spam-resistant reputation systems in decentralized networks. By incorporating trusted seed attestors and weighted attestations, this approach prevents Sybil attacks and spam manipulation while maintaining the distributed nature of reputation computation.

## Introduction

Traditional reputation systems face a fundamental challenge: how to bootstrap trust in a network where anyone can create multiple identities (Sybil attack). While PageRank provides an elegant solution for ranking web pages based on link authority, applying it directly to attestation networks creates vulnerabilities that malicious actors can exploit.

TrustAwarePageRank addresses these vulnerabilities by introducing the concept of **trusted seed attestors** - a carefully curated set of entities whose attestations carry additional weight and authority in the reputation computation.

## The Spam Problem in Traditional PageRank

### Vulnerability Overview

In a standard PageRank implementation applied to attestation networks:

1. **Equal Treatment**: All attestations are treated equally, regardless of the attester's reputation
2. **Bootstrap Problem**: New networks have no inherent trust structure
3. **Sybil Attacks**: Malicious actors can create numerous fake identities that attest to each other
4. **Spam Rings**: Coordinated networks of fake attestors can artificially inflate target scores

### Attack Vector Example

```
Legitimate Network:
Alice -> Bob -> Charlie -> Alice (natural attestation cycle)

Spam Network:
Spammer1 -> SpamTarget
Spammer2 -> SpamTarget  
Spammer3 -> SpamTarget
Spammer1 -> Spammer2 -> Spammer3 -> Spammer1 (artificial boost cycle)
```

**Result**: SpamTarget can achieve higher PageRank scores than legitimate entities despite having no real endorsements.

## TrustAwarePageRank Solution

### Core Principles

1. **Trusted Seeds**: Designate a set of trusted attestors whose endorsements carry additional weight
2. **Weighted Attestations**: Attestations from trusted seeds receive higher weight in score computation
3. **Trust Propagation**: Higher initial scores for trusted seeds allow trust to flow through the network
4. **Spam Isolation**: Spam networks become isolated from trusted pathways, reducing their influence

### Trust Mechanics

The algorithm incorporates trust through three mechanisms:

1. **Attestation Weight Multiplier**: Trusted attestor endorsements receive weight `W_trust > 1`
2. **Initial Score Boost**: Trusted seeds start with higher initial PageRank scores
3. **Damping Factor Application**: Trust flows through the network via the standard PageRank damping mechanism

## Algorithm Details

### Modified PageRank Formula

```
PR(i) = (1-d)/N + d * Σ(PR(j) * W(j,i) / L(j))
```

Where:
- `PR(i)` = PageRank score of node i
- `d` = damping factor (typically 0.85)
- `N` = total number of nodes
- `W(j,i)` = weight of attestation from j to i
- `L(j)` = total outgoing attestation weight from j

### Weight Assignment

```
W(j,i) = {
    W_trust * base_weight  if j ∈ TrustedSeeds
    base_weight           otherwise
}
```

### Initial Score Distribution

```
Initial_PR(i) = {
    trust_boost / |TrustedSeeds|  if i ∈ TrustedSeeds
    (1 - trust_boost) / (N - |TrustedSeeds|)  otherwise
}
```

```

### Computation Pipeline

1. **Attestation Ingestion**: Collect attestations from various sources
2. **Trust Validation**: Verify attestor identities against trusted seed list
3. **Graph Construction**: Build weighted adjacency matrix
4. **Score Computation**: Execute TrustAwarePageRank algorithm
5. **Merkle Tree Storage**: Store scores in verifiable data structure
6. **On-Chain Commitment**: Publish merkle root for verification

## Blockchain Integration

### Smart Contract Architecture

```solidity
contract TrustAwarePageRank {
    struct TrustConfig {
        address[] trustedSeeds;
        uint256 trustMultiplier;
        uint256 trustBoost;
        uint256 dampingFactor;
    }
    
    struct ComputationParams {
        uint256 maxIterations;
        uint256 convergenceTolerance;
        uint256 computationWindow;
    }
    
    mapping(address => bool) public isTrustedSeed;
    mapping(bytes32 => uint256) public scoreCommitments; // merkle roots
    
    event ScoreUpdate(bytes32 indexed merkleRoot, uint256 timestamp);
    event TrustSeedAdded(address indexed seed);
    event TrustSeedRemoved(address indexed seed);
}
```

### WAVS Integration

For WASI-based computation services:

```json
{
  "service_config": {
    "component": "trust-pagerank-compute",
    "inputs": {
      "attestations": "ipfs://...",
      "trust_config": "ipfs://...",
      "computation_params": "ipfs://..."
    },
    "outputs": {
      "score_merkle_root": "bytes32",
      "computation_proof": "bytes"
    }
  },
  "verification": {
    "type": "merkle_proof",
    "aggregation": "majority_consensus"
  }
}
```

### Gas Optimization

- **Off-chain Computation**: Heavy PageRank computation happens off-chain
- **Merkle Commitment**: Only store merkle root on-chain (~32 bytes)
- **Lazy Verification**: Verify individual scores only when needed
- **Batch Updates**: Process multiple attestation rounds together

## Use Cases

### 1. Decentralized Governance

```
Application: DAO Voting Power
- Trusted Seeds: Founding members, key contributors
- Attestations: Community endorsements, contribution validations
- Output: Voting weights based on community trust
```

### 2. Content Discovery

```
Application: Social Media Ranking
- Trusted Seeds: Verified creators, platform moderators
- Attestations: Content endorsements, quality signals
- Output: Content ranking scores for feeds
```

### 3. Identity Verification

```
Application: Web of Trust
- Trusted Seeds: Government entities, certified organizations
- Attestations: Identity verifications, credential endorsements
- Output: Identity confidence scores
```

### 4. DeFi Protocol Security

```
Application: Protocol Trustworthiness
- Trusted Seeds: Security firms, established protocols
- Attestations: Security audits, community validations
- Output: Protocol risk scores
```

## Security Considerations

### Trust Seed Selection

**Criteria for Trusted Seeds:**
- **Reputation**: Well-established entities with strong track records
- **Decentralization**: Diverse set to prevent central points of failure
- **Stake**: Economic incentives aligned with network health
- **Transparency**: Public identities with accountability

**Governance Process:**
1. **Community Proposal**: Suggest new trusted seeds
2. **Verification Period**: Validate credentials and reputation
3. **Consensus Vote**: Community approval mechanism
4. **Probationary Period**: Monitored integration with removal option

### Attack Mitigation

| Attack Type | Mitigation Strategy |
|-------------|-------------------|
| **Sybil Attack** | Trusted seed validation prevents fake identities from gaining authority |
| **Collusion** | Diverse trusted seed set reduces single-point-of-failure |
| **Trust Seed Compromise** | Multi-signature controls and community governance for seed management |
| **Eclipse Attack** | Multiple computation sources and consensus mechanisms |
| **Long-Range Attack** | Periodic trust seed rotation and historical verification |

### Privacy Considerations

- **Attestation Privacy**: Use commitment schemes for sensitive attestations
- **Score Privacy**: Optional private score ranges with zero-knowledge proofs
- **Identity Privacy**: Support pseudonymous participation while maintaining trust chains

## Future Work
