# The Plan

- Make frontend for proposals / approval
- Clean up configs, and make consistent
- Add Gov Paper

# Future work
- A DAO needs to be able to update it's own service configuration (needs Gyser)
- Better governance page UI (and experimental notice)
- Implement and document the fallback mechanism for governance (this should be fairly straightforward with Zodiac hopefully)
- Add Rewards so this is a complete DAO governance system
