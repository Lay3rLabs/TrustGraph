# The Plan

- Rename dao-agent -> actor

Flow:
- Propose -> approval -> execution


- Clean up code
- Config URI var
- Visualize flow and document demo

# Governance extra credit
- A DAO needs to be able to update it's own service configuration (related to Gyser?)
- Experimental notice on governance page
- create proposal doesn't submit amount as big int (it's in wei)
- Add threshold to Merkle Gov Module contract
- Implement and document the fallback mechanism for governance (this should be fairly straightforward with Zodiac hopefully)
- Conduct AI audit of contracts
- Add Gov Paper

# Rewards extra credit
- Add Rewards so this is a complete DAO governance system
- Activate rewards page?
