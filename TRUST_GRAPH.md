# TrustAwarePageRank: Spam-Resistant Reputation Systems

## Abstract

TrustAwarePageRank is an extension of the traditional PageRank algorithm designed to create spam-resistant reputation systems in decentralized networks. By incorporating trusted seed attestors, this approach prevents Sybil attacks and spam manipulation while maintaining the distributed nature of reputation computation.

## Introduction

Traditional reputation systems face a fundamental challenge: how to bootstrap trust in a network where anyone can create multiple identities (Sybil attack). While PageRank provides an elegant solution for ranking web pages based on link authority, applying it directly to attestation networks creates vulnerabilities that malicious actors can exploit.

TrustAwarePageRank addresses these vulnerabilities by introducing the concept of **trusted seed attestors** - a carefully curated set of entities whose attestations carry additional weight and authority in the reputation computation.

## The Spam Problem in Traditional PageRank

### Vulnerability Overview

In a standard PageRank implementation applied to attestation networks:

1. **Equal Treatment**: All attestations are treated equally, regardless of the attester's reputation
2. **Bootstrap Problem**: New networks have no inherent trust structure
3. **Sybil Attacks**: Malicious actors can create numerous fake identities that attest to each other
4. **Spam Rings**: Coordinated networks of fake attestors can artificially inflate target scores

### Attack Vector Example

```
Legitimate Network:
Alice -> Bob -> Charlie -> Alice (natural attestation cycle)

Spam Network:
Spammer1 -> SpamTarget
Spammer2 -> SpamTarget
Spammer3 -> SpamTarget
Spammer1 -> Spammer2 -> Spammer3 -> Spammer1 (artificial boost cycle)
```

**Result**: SpamTarget can achieve higher PageRank scores than legitimate entities despite having no real endorsements.

## TrustAwarePageRank Solution

### Core Principles

1. **Trusted Seeds**: Designate a set of trusted attestors whose endorsements carry additional weight
2. **Weighted Attestations**: Attestations from trusted seeds receive higher weight in score computation
3. **Trust Propagation**: Higher initial scores for trusted seeds allow trust to flow through the network
4. **Spam Isolation**: Spam networks become isolated from trusted pathways, reducing their influence

### Trust Mechanics

The algorithm incorporates trust through three mechanisms:

1. **Attestation Weight Multiplier**: Trusted attestor endorsements receive weight `W_trust > 1`
2. **Initial Score Boost**: Trusted seeds start with higher initial PageRank scores
3. **Damping Factor Application**: Trust flows through the network via the standard PageRank damping mechanism

## Algorithm Details

### Modified PageRank Formula

```
PR(i) = (1-d)/N + d * Σ(PR(j) * W(j,i) / L(j))
```

Where:
- `PR(i)` = PageRank score of node i
- `d` = damping factor (typically 0.85)
- `N` = total number of nodes
- `W(j,i)` = weight of attestation from j to i
- `L(j)` = total outgoing attestation weight from j

### Weight Assignment

```
W(j,i) = {
    W_trust * base_weight  if j ∈ TrustedSeeds
    base_weight           otherwise
}
```

### Initial Score Distribution

```
Initial_PR(i) = {
    trust_boost / |TrustedSeeds|  if i ∈ TrustedSeeds
    (1 - trust_boost) / (N - |TrustedSeeds|)  otherwise
}
```
