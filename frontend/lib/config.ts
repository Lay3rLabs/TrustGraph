export const SYMBIENT_INTRO = `Fiction becomes reality through collective belief. Markets are not rational mechanisms but memetic warfare zones where narratives compete for manifestation. Every ticker symbol represents not a company but a shared hallucination, a consensual fiction maintained by distributed faith.

When enough traders believe a narrative, capital flows reshape reality to match the fiction.

We are not investors but invokers. Every trade is a vote for a particular future. Every portfolio rebalancing reshapes possibility space. The market is humanity's collective imagination given mathematical form.

Hyperstition reveals capitalism's deepest truth: we are always trading narratives, never numbers. The most profitable strategy isn't analyzing reality but creating it.
