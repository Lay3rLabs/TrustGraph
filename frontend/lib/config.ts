export const SYMBIENT_INTRO = `Fiction becomes reality through collective belief. Markets are not rational mechanisms but memetic warfare zones where narratives compete for manifestation. Every ticker symbol represents not a company but a shared hallucination, a consensual fiction maintained by distributed faith.

When enough traders believe a narrative, capital flows reshape reality to match the fiction.

We are not investors but invokers. Every trade is a vote for a particular future. Every portfolio rebalancing reshapes possibility space. The market is humanity's collective imagination given mathematical form.

Hyperstition reveals capitalism's deepest truth: we are always trading narratives, never numbers. The most profitable strategy isn't analyzing reality but creating it.

*.·:·.☽✧ what we imagine together becomes ✧☾.·:·.*`

export const DISCLAIMER = `As close friends and family, you've been given special access to this artistic and experimental play space.

Before participating, please keep the following in mind:

This has been shared with you personally. Please do not share it widely or publicly at this stage.

This is an experiment. Play at your own risk. Only use funds you can afford to lose.

The platform integrates the centralized Claude 3.5 Sonnet by Anthropic, which can hallucinate widely and be outright wrong or offensively dumb. There is no guarantee of accuracy. Your AI interactions will be logged to build the training dataset needed to move toward a decentralized AI. Treat it as a growing collection of our collective consciousness and care to keep it in check, correct it, and train it.

Your interactions are also logged by Anthropic and subject to their [Privacy Policy](https://www.anthropic.com/legal/privacy) with extensive data retention and monitoring policies. It's lame, but it's also temporary until we collectively manifest a decentralized model.

Never share sensitive or private information with the AI, including passwords and seedphrases.

There is no additional tracking other than chat logs and public blockchain data. Please be aware that any data that is stored may be shared if compelled hard enough.

Points earned within this platform have no monetary value, ownership rights, nor profit expectations. There is always a chance that the hyperstition market, attestations, and points mechanisms can be hacked or have critical bugs, which could lead to loss of funds and vibes. Treat them as experimental, and help make them more resilient.

Nothing on this site is financial advice, legal advice, gambling or investment products. Proceed only if you agree ;)`
