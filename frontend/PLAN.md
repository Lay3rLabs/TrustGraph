- Make it look cool


The task today is art. We are launching EN0VA.

Here we have a basic terminal site, but the design is a little off. It's the little details and polish that matters:
- How text comes to be displayed.
- Selecting the right shades of gray for terminal text
- Elite ASCII art
- Minimalism
- Mystery
- Subtle background effects
- Less is more mentality

See INSPIRATION.md for inspiration. Have fun Claude.

I want to build a secret backroom for this site

We're making an attestation dashboard that allows people to make Ethereum Attestation Service Attestations.

Menu items include:
- Attestations
- EN0VA
- Governance
- Hyperstition Markets
- Profile
- Systems

Keep the same mimimalist aesthetic the site currently has (the vibe is amazing, keep it simple).

Use Wagmi and rainbowkit.


Let's work on the ICO page, a mockup is fine for now.

I want it to look like an app where people can actually purchase $EN0 tokens. It should be clear that this is "Phase 1", and that it's a limited time offer. There should be a "Your Discount" section where users can see their percentage discount as a result of their contributions. There should be a button to purchase tokens.

There should also be basic project info, but details should either be on another page or in a modal or tab or section.
