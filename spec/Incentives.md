# Attestation Based Incentives

Attestations are used to dirive metrics that payout incentives.

Attestations can be used to account for contributions and keep track of activity.

Types of things we might attest to:
- Following our Twitter account
- Contributing to Open Source
- Attending our events or webinars
- Providing feedback or suggestions for improvement
- Completing bounties
- Building something cool with WAVS
- Running a WAVS node
- Running a WAVS node with good uptime and performance
- Finding security vulnerabilities



An llm reviewer could review attestations (and make attestations about attestations that might relate to points or incentives payout).
